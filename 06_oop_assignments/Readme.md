# 🐍 Python OOP Assignments – 21 Assignments of Object-Oriented Programming

**Alhamdulillah!**  
This repository contains a comprehensive series of **21 Python Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Assignments**, each crafted to demonstrate and strengthen foundational OOP principles through hands-on coding.

---

## 📚 What's Inside?

Each assignment focuses on a core OOP concept including:

- ✅ Classes & Objects  
- ✅ Instance/Class/Static Methods & Variables  
- ✅ Inheritance (Single, Multilevel, Multiple, Diamond)  
- ✅ Access Modifiers  
- ✅ Abstract Classes  
- ✅ Composition vs Aggregation  
- ✅ Method Resolution Order (MRO)  
- ✅ Decorators (Function & Class)  
- ✅ Property Decorators  
- ✅ Custom Exceptions  
- ✅ Making Classes Iterable  
- ✅ Callable Objects

## 💡 Understanding Concepts Section

To enhance clarity, every assignment includes a **dedicated "Understanding Concepts"** section that breaks down:

- The core logic
- Key takeaways
- Comparisons (when needed)
- Real-life analogies (if applicable)

This makes the learning journey **easier not only for me but also for anyone revisiting or viewing the project**.
